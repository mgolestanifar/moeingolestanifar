        <h1>In my work, the properties of nano-materials are investigated by Spatial Self-Phase Modulation (SSPM) and Spatial Cross-Phase Modulation (SXPM) techniques. For this purpose, many optical elements such as biconvex lenses, pinholes, polarizers, and CCD camera have been applied in the SSPM and SXPM setup. Also, for Laser Ablation studying we have utilized Pulsed Laser (ns), biconvex lenses, mirrors, magnet, and stirrer. The superiority of this combined method is enhancing the optical nonlinearity of solutions by synthesizing nanoparticles inside it. Thanks to the optical nonlinear properties of materials, optical switching and limiting materials can be facilitated and studied in situ and after situ the experiment.</h1>
